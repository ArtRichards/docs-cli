# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 1.1.0 — UNRELEASED

The first PyPI release. Distribution name is `docs-cli`; the console-script
remains `docs`. No on-disk-convention changes.

### Added

- **PyPI distribution.** The CLI now ships as `docs-cli` on PyPI:
  `pip install docs-cli` lands `docs` on PATH via the
  `[project.scripts] docs = "docs_cli.cli:main"` entry point. The
  bundled Claude Code skill rides inside the wheel as package data
  under `docs_cli/skill/`, removing the previous requirement to clone
  the repo to use the skill.
- **`docs install-skill` verb (M6).** New subcommand that materialises
  the bundled skill onto a host. Flags: `--dest DIR` (default
  `~/.claude/skills/docs/`), `--copy` (default) / `--symlink`,
  `--force`, `--quiet`. Idempotent: a no-op when the destination is
  already byte-identical to the bundled source. Refuses `--symlink`
  on a wheel install (where the bundled skill lives under
  `site-packages` and could be replaced by a `pip install --upgrade`).
- **Global `--version` flag.** `docs --version` prints `docs 1.1.0`
  and exits 0.

### Changed

- **Package layout.** The single-file CLI moved from `bin/docs` to
  `src/docs_cli/cli.py`. The bundled skill moved from `skills/docs/`
  to `src/docs_cli/skill/`. Tests import the CLI via
  `from docs_cli import cli` (or `from docs import …` via the
  conftest's `sys.modules` alias).
- **Repository identity.** The local checkout and the GitHub repo
  both moved to `docs-cli` (was `docs`); the on-disk Markdown
  convention is unchanged (`Project: docs` stays `docs`).
- **Build backend.** `pyproject.toml` declares hatchling as the build
  backend; classifiers bumped from Alpha to Beta and now list Python
  3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13.

### Removed

- `bin/docs` — replaced by the editable-install / wheel entry point.
- Top-level `skills/docs/` — replaced by `src/docs_cli/skill/` (the
  in-tree source of truth shipped as wheel package data).
- `[tool.ruff] extend-include = ["bin/docs"]` and
  `[tool.mypy] scripts_are_modules = true` — no longer needed; the
  CLI is a regular package module.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-05-22

v1 complete: M1-M5 shipped across 2026-05-20 → 2026-05-22.

### Added

- M1 — Parser, walker, INDEX renderer, `docs index`, config loading.
- M2 — Mutating verbs `new`, `archive`, `mv`, `touch`.
- M3 — Validation (`check`) and query (`list`); INDEX regrouped by
  Project then Role.
- M4 — Migration helper `docs migrate` for adopting foreign Markdown
  trees into the convention (dry-run by default).
- M5 — Claude Code skill that drives the verbs automatically when an
  agent does documentation work in a `docs`-managed tree; bundled
  spec references (`convention.md`, `cli.md`) ship alongside.
